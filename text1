Everyday, we depend on many systems and machines. We use a car to travel, a lift go up and down, and a plane to fly. Electricity comes through turbines and in a hospital machine keeps us live. These systems can fail. Some failures are an inconvenience while others could mean life and death.
When stakes are high, we perform regular maintenance on our systems. For example, cars are serviced once every few months and aircrafts are serviced daily. However, as we will discuss in detail later in this article, these approaches result in the resources wastage.
Predictive maintenance predict failure, and the result could be corrective actions, replacement of system, or even  planned failure. This can lead to major cost savings, higher predictability,  and increased availability of the systems.
