To understand the dynamics, let’s consider a taxi company. If a taxi breaks down, the company need to pacify an unhappy customer, send a replacement, and both the taxi and driver will be out of service while in repair. Cost of failure is much higher than it’s apparent cost.
One way to deal with this problem is to be pessimistic and replace fallible components well before failures.  For example, regular maintenance operations, such as changing engine oil, replacing tires, do this. Although regular maintenance is better than failures, we will end up doing the maintenance before it’s needed. Hence, it is not an optimal solution. For example, changing oil of a vehicle for every 3000 miles might not use oil effectively. If we can predict failures better , the  the taxi can few hundred miles without replacing oil.
Predictive maintenance avoid both the extremes and maximize the use of its resources. Predictive maintenance will detect the anomalies and failure patterns and provide early warnings. These warnings can enable efficient maintenance of those components.

These warnings can enable efficient maintenance of those components.To understand the dynamics, let’s consider a taxi company. If a taxi breaks down, the company need to pacify an unhappy customer, send a replacement, and both the taxi and driver will be out of service while in repair. Cost of failure is much higher than it’s apparent cost.
One way to deal with this problem is to be pessimistic and replace fallible components well before failures.  For example, regular maintenance operations, such as changing engine oil, replacing tires, do this. Although regular maintenance is better than failures, we will end up doing the maintenance before it’s needed. Hence, it is not an optimal solution. For example, changing oil of a vehicle for every 3000 miles might not use oil effectively. If we can predict failures better , the  the taxi can few hundred miles without replacing oil.
Predictive maintenance avoid both the extremes and maximize the use of its resources. Predictive maintenance will detect the anomalies and failure patterns and provide early warnings.
